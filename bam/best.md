Bam Error Stats Tool (best): analysis of error types in aligned reads.

`best` is used to assess the quality of reads after aligning them to a
reference assembly.

## Features

* Collect overall and per alignment stats
* Distribution of indel lengths
* Yield at different empirical Q-value thresholds
* Bin per read stats to easily examine the distribution of errors for certain
  types of reads
* Stats for regions specified by intervals (BED file, homopolymer regions,
  windows etc.)
* Stats for quality scores vs empirical Q-values
* Multithreading for speed

## Usage

The [`best` Usage Guide](Usage.md) gives an overview of how to use `best`.

## Installing

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Clone this repository and navigate into the directory of this repository.
3. Run `cargo install --locked --path .`
4. Run `best input.bam reference.fasta prefix/path`

This will generate stats files with the `prefix/path` prefix.

## Development

### Running

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Clone this repository and navigate into the directory of this repository.
3. Run `cargo build --release`
4. Run `cargo run --release -- input.bam reference.fasta prefix/path` or
   `target/release/best input.bam reference.fasta prefix/path`

This will generate stats files with the `prefix/path` prefix.

The built binary is located at `target/release/best`.

### Formatting

```
cargo fmt
```

### Comparing

Remember to pass the `-t 1` option to ensure that only one thread is used for
testing. Best generally tries to ensure the order of outputs is deterministic
with multiple threads, but the order of per-alignment stats is arbitrary unless
only one thread is used.
