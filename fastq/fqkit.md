## usage

```bash
FqKit -- A simple and cross-platform program for fastq file manipulation

Version: 0.4.8

Authors: sharkLoc <mmtinfo@163.com>
Source code: https://github.com/sharkLoc/fqkit.git

Fqkit supports reading and writing gzip (.gz) format.
Bzip2 (.bz2) format is supported since v0.3.8.
Xz (.xz) format is supported since v0.3.9.
Under the same compression level, xz has the highest compression ratio but consumes more time. 

Compression level:
  format   range   default   crate
  gzip     1-9     6         https://crates.io/crates/flate2
  bzip2    1-9     6         https://crates.io/crates/bzip2
  xz       1-9     6         https://crates.io/crates/xz2

Global Arguments:
      --compress-level <INT>  set gzip/bzip2/xz compression level 1 (compress faster) - 9 (compress better) for gzip/bzip2/xz output file, just work with option -o/--out [default: 6]

  -v, --verbosity...          control verbosity of logging, [-v: Error, -vv: Warn, -vvv: Info, -vvvv: Debug, -vvvvv: Trace, defalut: Debug]

Global FLAGS:
  -q, --quiet    be quiet and do not show any extra information
  -h, --help     prints help information
  -V, --version  prints version information
